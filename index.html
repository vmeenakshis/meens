Nothing is as far away as one second ago... <br />

Hi! What's up? Thank you for visiting my site! I am here to share my work experience, mostly of Microsoft Technologies, especially .Net,  and ColdFusion (CFML). If possible other technologies and languages as well!

Who AM I? I launched this site in 2006 as a personal website. But never thought about it seriously until 2020. Or may be still not. Just like most of those techies, I come from a village, located southern corner of Tamil Nadu, India. My certificate reads BE Computer Science but I should admit, I still have no idea what the dash it is.

Career: I started as teaching staff in browsing center and then took many versions (like software product), to become that typical software guy (the one who proudly says I'm in IT) in India. Now I work for some company with title somewhere readong "as an Architect" but god help me, I have no idea!..  All I do for living is that, There is a job portal kind of a product that my client owns, so I'm given with daily JIRA tickets for resolving bugs/issues/task etc.

Hobbies: I like writing code that makes daily life easy. I like buying techie stuff online. Sometimes little soft, melodious music but never those noisy or fast beats. I was a cricket player in school and collage, so not a big fan of watching but playing. That's it for now. Hope you enjoy this site. I'll appreciate your comments and suggestions.

Please write to me your feedback vmeenashis@gmail.com

Thank you

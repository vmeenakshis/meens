Hi! What's up? Thank you for visiting my page! I am here to share my work experience, mostly of Microsoft Technologies, especially .Net, and ColdFusion (CFML). If possible other technologies and languages as well!

- Who AM I? 
I am just no one. Certificate reads BE Computer Science but I should admit, 
I still have no idea what the dash it is. 

- Career?
I started as teaching staff in browsing center and then took many versions (like software product), 
to become a typical software guy just like you. I am also one of those who proudly says I'm in IT eventhough no one cares. 
I work for some company with title "as an Architect" but god help me, I have no idea on that too!.. 
All I do for living is, solving JIRA tickets etc. 

- Hobbies? 
I like writing code that makes daily life easy. I also like buying techie stuff online. 
Sometimes soft, melodious music but never those noisy or fast beats. 
I was a cricket player in school and collage, so not a big fan of watching but playing. 
That's it for now. Now you can go and find someone else page and continue your reading hobby. 

-- "Thank you"
